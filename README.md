# Machine Learning & Numerical Optimization [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dmeoli/MachineLearningNumericalOptimization.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dmeoli/MachineLearningNumericalOptimization)

This code is a simple and modular implementation of some of the most important optimization algorithms used as core 
solver for many machine learning models developed during the Machine Learning & Numerical Methods and Optimization 
courses @ [Department of Computer Science](https://www.di.unipi.it/en/) @ [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english).
